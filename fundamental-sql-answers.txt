#### Exercises

> 1. List the commands for adding, updating, and deleting data.

    A: 
    Adding: INSERT INTO
    Updating: UPDATE
    Deleting: DELETE FROM


> 2. Explain the structure for each type of command.

    A:
    INSERT INTO [table] (column1, column2, ...)
    VALUES
    (value for column1, value for column2, ...),
    ...;

    - Defines what table we are inserting data into, then lists the columns the values correspond to. Finally it defines the rows with values to be added.


    UPDATE [table] SET [column]=[new value] WHERE [condition]

    - Defines the table then "SET"s which column's value will change. Uses the "WHERE" keyword to define which row is changing.


    DELETE FROM [table] WHERE [condition]

    - Defines the table then specifies which row(s) to delete based on the condition. Can use multiple WHERE clauses to be more specific.


> 3. What are some of the data types that can be used in tables? Give a real-world example of each type.

    A:
    Numbers - inventory level
    Text - product names
    Date - date when product was purchased


> 4. Decide how to create a new table to hold a list of people invited to a wedding dinner. The table needs to have first and last names, whether they sent in their RSVP, the number of guests they are bringing, and the number of meals (1 for adults and 1/2 for children).

    > 4.1 Which data type would you use to store each of the following pieces of information?
        
        > 4.1.1 First and last name.

            A: text

        > 4.1.2 Whether they sent in their RSVP.

            A: boolean

        > 4.1.3 Number of guests.

            A: integer

        > 4.1.4 Number of meals.

            A: numeric(2, 1)


    > 4.2 Write a command that creates the table to track the wedding dinner.

        A: 
        CREATE TABLE wedding_dinner (
            first_name text,
            last_name text,
            sent_RSVP boolean,
            guests integer,
            meals numeric(2, 1)
        );
    
    > 4.3 Write a command that adds a column to track whether the guest sent a thank you card.

        A:
        ALTER TABLE wedding_dinner ADD COLUMN sent_thankyou boolean;

    > 4.4 You have decided to move the data about the meals to another table, so write a command to remove the column storing the number meals from the wedding table.

        A:
        ALTER TABLE wedding_dinner DROP COLUMN meals;
    
    > 4.5 The guests will need a place to sit at the reception, so write a command that adds a column for table number.

        A:
        ALTER TABLE wedding_dinner ADD COLUMN table_number integer;

    > 4.6 The wedding is over and we do not need to keep this information, so write a command that deletes the table numbers from the database.

        A:
        ALTER TABLE wedding_dinner DROP COLUMN table_number;

> 5. Write a command to create a new table to hold the books in a library with the columns ISBN, title, author, genre, publishing date, number of copies, and available copies.

    A:
    CREATE TABLE library (
        ISBN integer,
        title text,
        author text,
        genre text,
        publishing_date date,
        copies integer,
        available_copies integer
    );

    > 5.1 Find three books and add their information to the table.
    
        A:
        INSERT INTO library
        VALUES
        (9783732423234, "Databases and Me: A Memoir", "Suzy Query", "Biography", 2015/03/01, 3, 2),
        (9781827332423, "Table Drop", "M. Night Databasy", "Horror", 2011/09/11, 2, 2),
        (9783225672039, "Insert Love Where Heart = Broken", "Gloria Sequel", "Romance", 2009/02/14, 1, 0);

    > 5.2 Someone has just checked out one of the books. Change the number of available copies to 1 fewer.
    
        A:
        UPDATE library SET available_copies = available_copies - 1 WHERE ISBN = 9781827332423;

    > 5.3 Now one of the books has been added to the banned books list. Remove it from the table.

        A:
        DELETE FROM library WHERE ISBN = 9783225672039;

> 6. Write a command to make a new table to hold spacecrafts. Information should include id, name, year launched, country of origin, a brief description of the mission, orbiting body, if it is currently operating, and its approximate miles from Earth. 

    A:

    CREATE TABLE spacecrafts (
        id integer,
        name text,
        yearLaunched integer,
        originCountry text,
        mission text,
        orbiting text,
        operating boolean,
        milesAway integer
    );

    > 6.1 Add three non-Earth-orbiting satellites to the table.
    
        A:
        INSERT INTO spacecrafts
        VALUES
        (11319, "Vito", 2013, "Greece", "Find alternative sources of olive oil", "Venus", TRUE, 66700000),
        (42142, "Kitty", 2010, "Japan", "Beam cat videos to aliens", "Pluto", TRUE, 7500000000),
        (5344, "Eagle", 1985, "USA", "Kill commie aliens", "Mars", TRUE, 91000000)

    > 6.2 Remove one of the satellites from the table since it has just crashed into the planet.

        A:
        DELETE FROM spacecrafts WHERE id=5344;

    > 6.3 Edit another satellite because it is no longer operating and change the value to reflect that.

        A:
        UPDATE spacecrafts SET operating=FALSE WHERE id=42142;

> 7. Write a command to create a new table to hold the emails in your inbox. This table should include an id, the subject line, the sender, any additional recipients, the body of the email, the timestamp, whether or not you have read the email, and the id of the email chain it's in. 

    A:
    CREATE TABLE inbox (
        id integer,
        subjectLine text,
        sender text,
        addRecipients text,
        body text,
        timestamp timestamp,
        read boolean,
        idChain integer
    );

    > 7.1 Add three new emails to the inbox.
    
        A:
        INSERT INTO inbox 
        VALUES
        (432, "Hey...", "JessicaRabbit@looneytoons.com", "Rodger Rabbit", "We need to talk about last night", 1999-01-08 04:05:06, FALSE, 457),
        (63456, "INCREASE YOUR PEN COLLECTION", "Totally.legit.email@notfake.co", "BUY NOW OR SHE'LL NEVER LOVE YOU", 2009-01-08 04:05:06, TRUE, NULL),
        (7547, "Tax Bill", "billing@irs.com", "trump@president.com", "This is your final warning. Pay now or go to jail.", 2011-01-08 04:05:06, FALSE, 12357),

    > 7.2 You deleted one of the emails, so write a command to remove the row from the inbox table.

        A:
        DELETE FROM inbox WHERE id = 63456;

    > 7.3 You started reading an email but just heard a crash in another room. Mark the email as unread before investigating the crash, so you can come back and read it later.

        A:
        UPDATE inbox SET read=FALSE WHERE id=7547;
