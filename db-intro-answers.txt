> 2. Explain when a database would be used. Explain when a text file would be used.

A: A database is used when you you need to create, store, and modify data. Examples include a phonebook, a todo list, or financial records. A database allows you to easily create records and store them securely for future use, when you can then retreive and even modify exisiting records.

A text file is used for data that does not need to be constantly retreived or modified. Examples include the code for a website, or the text for a blog post. This data does not need to be updated at a regular basis and should remain static when being used.


> 3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.
